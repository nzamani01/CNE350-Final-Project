PowerShell is a powerful command-line shell built to help with task automation by utilizing its scripting language.  While initially developed for Windows, PowerShell has now been ported to multiple operating systems and architectures. This means that you can even install PowerShell to the Raspberry Pi since it now has support for the ARM architecture. Installing this shell is helpful if you are used to dealing with the PowerShell language.
